# MealPlanner
R Shiny application to randomly select meals from a database of favorites.

Starting out with very bare-bones application with very simplistic meal database.
Future plans:
  Add support for ingredient lists with recipes (add UI for user-entered meals to include ingredients, and build shopping list)
  Add support for pulling recipes from a URL (probably pick one preferred recipe site at first, maybe with an API)
  
I'm building this selfishly because when we're busy, my husband and I hate meal planning. This leads to a lot of pretty lame dinners. I plan to use this personally, and it's good practice in Shiny, which I haven't used much.
